# Rule Scout: Watching for Proposed Federal Rules

⚠️ **This is very much an experiment.** The code is messy and prone to rapid change. It may also be discontinued.

Rule Scout watches U.S. Federal Government web and data services for information about proposed regulatory rules, then seeds database and wiki pages with basic information that people can use to start researching more about the rule, its context, and potential reasons (and content) for public comments.
